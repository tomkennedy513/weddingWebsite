        aboutParagraph: "Emma has been by my side from the very beginning. We met at Little Sparrows Preschool when we were 3 years old and have been inseparable ever since. From awkward middle school years and high school parties to attending Villanova together and even joining the same sorority, Emma and I have been soul sisters for over 20 years. I truly would not be the person I am today if I hadn’t gone through life with Emma by my side. We have been talking about being each other's Maid of Honor since we were 12 and I couldn’t be more thrilled that that time has come!"
